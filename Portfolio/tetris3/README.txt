As the instructor said on piazza post which is https://piazza.com/class/kbgv78l4lg34wv?cid=191.
I requested the instructor to add some essential c++ libraries on the school server, 
so my program can be ran on the flip server. 
However, as I checked at the date of Aug 11 (12:01am), some of libraries I requested are not available yet.

So please understand that my program might not be ran on the school server.
Also please understand that I was not able to test my program on the school server because of the absence of libraries.

Please test my program on another machin (Recommend the Microsoft Visual Studio 2019).

My working environment:
OS: window 10
IDE: microsoft visual studio community 2019

Requried library to run:

<iostream>
<iomanip>
<windows.h>
<conio.h>
<ctime>
<cstdlib>

So, please make sure you have all the library listed above in your IDE, so the program can be ran.


---Just in case---
If all the library I included the makefile, so you can just enter makefile, then it will compile all the files for you. Then simply run game by typing ./game
