It contains the information on how to compolile the files.
I used c++ programming language for the HW 1.

Question 4
Please make sure you have the data.txt on the same directory. And compile the codes by typing
g++ -o mergeTest mergesort. cpp
g++ -o insertTest mergesort. cpp

and simply run the program ./mergeTest and ./insertTest

Question 5
I am used the chrono library to compute time execution time. It will not be ran low version of c++ compiler.
So please compile higher version of compiler.
You can compile the file using the code below

g++ -std=c++11 -o insertTtest insertTime.cpp
g++ -std=c++11 -o mergeTtest mergeTime.cpp

After complete the compile, simply run the program by typing ./insertTest and ./mergeTest
